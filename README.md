## [Search Predicted Tidal Extremes](https://d20hwmqjn6z198.cloudfront.net)

### How To
- Use autoselect to search places
- Move pins with Latitude and Longitude inputs
- Store user preferences via form in Info Modal
- __If There is a search error, it's most likely because the location coordinates are not within one degree of latitude or longitude of an observation station__

### Goals
- Use the affordances of AWS Amplify framework to rapidly and reliably complete a coding exercise
- Create robust and unique client dynamics for end-user
- Use useful technologies: Material-UI, GraphQL, DynamoDB, express
- Get outside of comfort zone by using React Hooks and not using Redux or Redux-Saga
